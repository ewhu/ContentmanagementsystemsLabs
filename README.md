**Content Management Systems Labs**
**Empowering Developers with Modular CMS Frameworks**

Content Management Systems Labs is a comprehensive repository of modular CMS frameworks built using TypeScript, designed to streamline content management and provide unparalleled flexibility for developers. This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with innovative content management solutions, fostering collaboration, and sharing knowledge among developers.

The purpose of Content Management Systems Labs is to provide a robust and adaptable foundation for building custom content management systems, enabling developers to focus on creating unique experiences without worrying about the underlying architecture. This repository offers a range of features that cater to diverse use cases, from simple blogging platforms to complex enterprise-level content management systems.

By leveraging the power of TypeScript, our modular CMS frameworks ensure maintainable, scalable, and efficient codebases. The repository includes a collection of pre-built modules, each addressing specific content management requirements, such as user management, content modeling, and workflow management. This modular approach allows developers to pick and choose the components that best suit their projects, reducing the complexity and overhead associated with traditional monolithic CMS solutions.

**Key Features**

* **Modular Architecture**: Content Management Systems Labs is built using a modular architecture, enabling developers to effortlessly integrate or remove modules as needed.
* **TypeScript**: Leverages the power of TypeScript to ensure maintainable, scalable, and efficient codebases.
* **Content Modeling**: Provides a robust content modeling system, allowing developers to define custom content types and structures.
* **User Management**: Offers a built-in user management system, complete with role-based access control and authentication mechanisms.
* **Workflow Management**: Includes a workflow management module, enabling developers to create custom workflows and approval processes.
* **API-First Approach**: Exposes a comprehensive API, allowing developers to interact with the CMS framework programmatically.

**Technology Stack**

* **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript, used for its type safety, maintainability, and scalable nature.
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment, utilized for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
* **Express.js**: A popular Node.js web framework, chosen for its lightweight, flexible, and modular architecture.
* **MongoDB**: A NoSQL document-based database, used for its scalability, high performance, and flexible data model.

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ContentmanagementsystemsLabs.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root.
3. Set up the database by creating a new MongoDB instance and updating the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
4. Start the application using `npm run start`.

**Configuration**

* **Environment Variables**:
	+ `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for the MongoDB instance.
	+ `NODE_ENV`: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., development, production).
* **Settings**:
	+ `contentModel.json`: A JSON file defining the custom content types and structures.

**Usage**

* **API Documentation**: The API documentation can be accessed at `<http://localhost:3000/api/docs>`.
* **Content Modeling**: Create custom content types by defining a `contentModel.json` file in the root of the project.
* **User Management**: Use the built-in user management API to create, read, update, and delete users.
